# Hand-Movement-Recognition_ESP32_MPU6050
This is a hand movement recognition project using ESP32-PICO D4, this project classifies hand movements using machine learning methods.
I made this project to help parents who are paralyzed and can only lie on a bed, so they can call their guards just by moving their hands
